# React-Paste-Application

A simple and clean web app built with React to create, edit, delete, and manage text snippets (like mini notes or pastes). This project helps users quickly save text data and retrieve it later — similar to Pastebin but simpler and fully local.

# Description

The React Paste App allows users to:

Add and update pastes (title + content)

Delete pastes when no longer needed

Search through existing pastes easily

Copy paste content directly to clipboard

Automatically store all data locally (via Redux or localStorage)

It’s a beginner-friendly project demonstrating key React concepts — components, props, hooks, Redux state management, and routing.

# Features

Search functionality

Clipboard copy option

Responsive UI built using React + Tailwind CSS

# Setup
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/react-paste-app.git
